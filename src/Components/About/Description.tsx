        Born in Tzaneen and raised in the beautiful city of Pretoria where I
        currently reside and study to further my knowledge of the IT landscape
        in everything from building plaforms to leveraging data and
        infrastructure.

        Beyond IT, I'm an avid reader and find great pleasure in hitting the
        Golf course to develop my Golf game and register a low handicap - who
        knows, maybe I'm talented enough to go pro.
